    <center><h1>Hospital Analytics For HealthCare Data
    </h1></center>
             Health data is any data relating to the health of an individual patient or collective population. This information is gathered from a series of health information systems (HIS) and other technological tools utilized by health care professionals, insurance companies and government organizations. 
    
        <h2>How Data Analytics Leads to Health Care Solutions</h2>
          Health care data management has the potential to lead to better care if used properly. With centralized datasets, there is immediate access to necessary information whenever and wherever it is needed. The addition of big data analytics improves efficiency on all fronts. Better data leads to better care. 
<h2>Applications of Data Analytics in Health Care</h2>

  Data analytics can have far-reaching effects on the health care industry. Here are three examples to consider for your organization.</p>
   <h2> 1. Evaluating and Developing Practitioners</h2>
    
         Data gathered from patients regarding their experiences with medical practitioners can be analyzed to reveal areas for improvement.One example is Dr. Helen Riess’s research on empathy in physicians. After noticing that objective, scientific facts were often prioritized over a patient’s experience of their symptoms during appointments, she conducted a study in which patients rated their doctors on a scale of how empathetic they perceived them to be during visits. After gathering the data, half of the doctors received empathy training, while the other half did not.The doctors were again rated, and the group that received training was rated more empathetic than the control group. By analyzing patient-reported data, Riess discovered that training could increase physicians empathy, which has been associated with greater patient safety and fewer malpractice claims.</p>
    
   
   <h2>2.Detecting Anomalies in Scans</h2>
    
      Another way to leverage data analytics in health care is with machine-learning algorithms. When used correctly, algorithms can analyze data more quickly and efficiently than humans. For instance, in 2018, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created an algorithm that detects differences between 3D medical images, such as MRI scans. Because of the algorithm’s ability to learn based on data it’s previously received, it can identify differences in scans more than one thousand times faster than a human doctor.In the Harvard Online course Data Science Principles, Professor Dustin Tingley warns against relying too heavily on algorithms.“Without human thought and guidance throughout the entire process, none of these seemingly fantastical machine-learning applications would be possible,” Tingley says.When paired with your critical thinking and knowledge as a medical practitioner, machine-learning algorithms could potentially save both time and lives.Related: The Advantages of Data-Driven Decision-Making
    <h2>3. Predicting Outbreaks</h2>
    
         Data analytics can also predict trends in the spread of illness, allowing doctors’ offices, hospitals, schools, and individuals to adequately prepare.In Data Science Principles, Tingley explains how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) leverages data to predict the next flu outbreak.“The CDC has been collecting data about reported cases of the flu for over a decade,” Tingley says. “Using that data to help forecast the severity of future flu seasons can help you make decisions.”In the course, Tingley outlines how the CDC gathers flu data from participating doctors’ offices and hospitals, and how that data informs the actions of local decision-makers, such as school principals. This is an example of both predictive and prescriptive analytics because the CDC uses historic and current data to predict trends and drive action.Similar to the flu example is the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Analyzing data to predict future spikes in cases can help hospitals ensure staff have enough personal protective equipment and patient beds. It can also enable school administrators to decide whether in-person learning is a safe option, and individuals to make sound choices regarding personal safety and hygiene, social distancing, and travel.
